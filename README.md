# Quotes by greatest people

> "Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier"- by ***Mother Teresa*** <br>
> "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched â€” they must be felt with the heart"- by ***Helen Keller***

# Algorithm on Algebra
 
> Algebra is one of the definitive and oldest branches of mathematics, and design of computer algorithms is one of the youngest.
Despite this generation gap, the two disciplines beautifully interweave. Firstly, modern computers would be somewhat useless if they were not able to carry out arithmetic and algebraic computations efficiently, so we need to think on dedicated, sometimes rather sophisticated algorithms for these operations.
